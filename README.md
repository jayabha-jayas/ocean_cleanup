Welcome to **Ocean Cleanup!** Flutter and Flame engine-based mobile game, with _**Google Wallet Integration**_ focused on ocean environmental awareness and having Japanese localisation with multilevel and responsive multi-platform support. \
Make a change in the world by learning and sharing about the ocean.

## Inspiration

Organisations like [The Ocean Cleanup](https://theoceancleanup.com/) , [Ocean Conservation Namibia](https://www.ocnamibia.org/ ) are working tirelessly to clean the ocean and save marine life. 
We found the initiative very impactful and aspire to join and contribute in raising awareness about the ongoing crisis in the ocean. So, we developed the Ocean Cleanup game.

## What it does

**Raises Awareness:** \
Our game educated players about ocean pollution - fishing nets, hooks and garbage patch issues, why it is happening, what are the ongoing solutions and organisations helping, and how you as an Individual can contribute to cleaning up the ocean.  

**Inspires Action:** \
By immersing players in a world where they will actively collect the plastic and other debris from the ocean, the game motivates individuals to take real-world action to protect marine ecosystems. 

**Encourages Engagement:** \
Through interactive gameplay and Google Wallet integration, the game encourages players to participate in ocean cleanup and get a card as an reward to their google wallet.

**Promotes Learning:** \
Integrated educational content and videos that will provide players with valuable insights into marine life,impact of fishing nets,  hooks,plastic and the importance of preserving ocean habitats. 

**Tackle different patches:** \
As players progress through each level, they will clear different garbage patches around the world.

Our goal is simple: raise awareness and encourage action. We want players to feel empowered to change the world.

## How we built it

As a newbie in game development, we utilised [Flutter Casual Games Toolkit](https://flutter.dev/games) for starter template. 
Flutter and Dart helped us build the app's core. 
We used Flame to make the game engaging, and Figma to design the user interface.
We collaborated using Github and Teams.
Together, these tools helped us create Ocean cleanup, aiming to make a positive impact. 

## Challenges we ran into

The first challenge was we got introduced to hackathon pretty late in February. And we were just flutter developers with no experience in gaming and Flame engine. And our ideation process was also a difficult situation because we had really small time to build whatever we were ideating.

Also because of the same reason, we couldn't bring a few of our most innovative ideas into action and we have added those in the next steps.

As animation rookies, we were learning a lot about animation day by day and started creating sprite sheets and rive animations.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

In just 1 month, our team of two has successfully created a beautiful, functional, multiplatform and potentially impactful game using our favourite technology, Flutter. We're proud of delivering a product that has the potential to reach a wide audience and make a positive difference in the world.

## What we learned
Environment wise we learned that microplastics are everywhere now. In the ocean, our drinking water, our food and in our bodies right now. How microplastics are disrupting marine ecosystems.

Technology wise we learned about localisation in app, game development, animation, designing UI, adding videos in app, flame engine, Google Wallet integration, moving background ,  and much more.

## What's next for Ocean Cleanup

Ocean has many other issues apart from the plastic patches that are floating across it. We are planning on covering issues like dead zone(where marine life is destroyed by release of industrial chemicals and there is no oxygen) and the animals like seals, dolphins, manta rays, and many other creatures are facing issues like getting tied up in a fishing rope, or getting caught in hook or other plastic items floating in the ocean. Also they are trying to eat them and dying. 

Our next steps involve creating more levels for the game with all the issues happening in ocean and trying to create a more powerful impact and there is an idea to innovatively add the google wallet card into the app, where the user will be starting to play a level where they will be helping a dolphin to free from a plastic fork in its mouth and to get a forceps, you will have to either collect some amount of tokens from the default game or add to google wallet and get a free pass.

Our next steps involve releasing the game on the Play Store and App Store to reach a wider audience. We aim to continue spreading awareness about the environmental issues highlighted in the game and inspire more individuals to take action.
